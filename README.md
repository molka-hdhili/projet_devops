## Local Usage

Since Node is on the backend, server.js is the main file that acts as the server.

First set the environment to "development" if executing on localhost using the command line on windows.

<code>set NODE_ENV=development</code>

Then,

<code>node server.js</code>

Server will be listening on port 3030.
